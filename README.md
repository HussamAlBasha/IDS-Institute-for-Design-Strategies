# Internship at ISD

## Soundscapy 
This section is based on this repository: https://github.com/MitchellAcoustics/Soundscapy

Under this folder you can find a simple tutorial that helps you:

### 1.	Setting Up Visual Studio Code 
### 2.	Cloning the repository in VSCode
### 3.	Using Soundscapy library that is used for:
    a)	Binaural Recording Analysis
        i)	Prepping the Results Dataframe
        ii)	Load in a Binaural Recording
        iii)	Calculating Acoustic Metrics(Python Acoustics, scikit-maad, MoSQITo)
        iv)	Defining Analysis Settings
    b)	Statistical Analysis of the ISD Dataset
        i)	Loading the Data
        ii)	Filtering the Data
        iii)	Validating the Data
        iv)	Calculating the ISOPleasant and ISOEventful Coordinate Values
    c)	Plotting
         i) Plotting Functions for Visualizing Circumplex Data
            (1)	Scatter Plots
            (2)	Distribution (Density) Plots
            (3)	Jointplot
        ii)	Plotting Functions for Visualizing Likert Scale Data
            (1)	Radar/Spider Plot

## R EFA CFA SEM

Under this folder you can find a simple tutorial that helps you build and run you Model, test it and run it.

### 1. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
EFA is a statistical technique used in data analysis to uncover the underlying structure of a set 
of observed variables. The main goal of EFA is to understand the relationships among a large 
number of variables by reducing them into a smaller set of underlying factors. These factors 
represent the shared variance among the observed variables and can provide insights into the 
underlying constructs or dimensions being measured.

### 2. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
CFA is a subset of SEM that focuses on evaluating the measurement properties of latent 
constructs or factors. It is primarily used to assess the validity and reliability of a 
measurement instrument or questionnaire. CFA allows researchers to test whether the 
observed variables (indicators) in a dataset adequately reflect the underlying latent constructs 
they are intended to measure. CFA examines the relationship between the observed variables
and the latent factors and estimates factor loadings, which indicates the strength of the 
relationship between the observed variables and the latent factors.

### 3. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)
SEM is a more comprehensive statistical framework that encompasses CFA but goes beyond 
it. SEM includes not only the measurement model (CFA) but also a structural model that 
examines the relationships between latent variables (factors) and other observed variables. In 
other words, SEM allows researchers to simultaneously test the measurement model and the 
structural model, thereby examining the relationships and causal pathways between variables.
