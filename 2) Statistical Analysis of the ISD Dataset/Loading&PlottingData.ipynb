However, it is possible to use data which, although structured the same way, has a different range of values. For instance this could be a 7-point Likert scale, or a 0 to 100 scale. By passing these numbers both to `validate_dataset()` and `add_paq_coords()` as the `val_range`, `Soundscapy` will check that the data conforms to what is expected and will automatically scale the ISOCoordinates from -1 to +1 depending on the original value range. \n","\n","For example:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Renaming PAQ columns.\n","Checking PAQ data quality.\n","PAQ quality confirmed.

Taking inspiration from noise annoyance, we propose a move toward discussing the \"percent of people likely to perceive\" a soundscape as pleasant, vibrant, etc. when it is necessary to use numerical descriptions. In this way, a numerical design goal could also be set as e.g. \"the soundscape should be likely to be perceived as pleasant by at least 75% of users\" or the results of an intervention presented as e.g. \"the likelihood of the soundscape being perceived as calm increased from 30% to 55%\". These numbers can be drawn from either actual surveys or from the results of predictive models.\n","\n","Finally, although acknowledging the distribution of responses is crucial, it is sometimes necessary to summarise locations down to a single point to compare many different locations and to easily investigate how the soundscape assessment has generally changed over time. For this purpose, the mean of the ISOPleasant and ISOEventful values across all respondents is calculated to result in a single coordinate point per location. This clearly mirrors the original intent of the coordinate transformation presented in the ISO, but by applying the transformation first to each individual assessment then calculating the mean value, it maintains a direct link to the distributions shown above. \n","\n","We have included a function for creating a numerical summary of each location. For this, we first calculate the mean ISOPleasant and ISOEventful value for the location, giving a single coordinate to describe the location in the circumplex. We then calculate the percentage of overall responses falling in the `pleasant` or `eventful` halfs, or in the `vibrant`, `chaotic`, etc.
